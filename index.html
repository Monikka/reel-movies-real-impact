				<p class="lead">Movies allow us to escape realism. They let us
					dive into fictional worlds, take us places we have never been,
					broaden our perspectives and open our eyes to a wider world. It is
					almost as if there has been a spell cast that keeps our eyes glued
					to the screen and lets our mind wander into newer worlds. Every
					time I see a movie, while I watch them in awe, I can’t prevent myself from
					wondering if the time and money that went into entertaining us for
					a little while is worth the effort. But what is it that makes
					movies more appealing to people than any other form of art? It is
					as if there is magic that keeps our eyes glued to the screen.</p>
					
					<p class="lead">Despite being a time-consuming tedious process that involves
					hundreds of people and thousands of dollars, the industry has only
					been growing steadily with no signs of slowing down in the coming
					years. In recent times, there has been sleuth of movies being
					released that not only captivate the audience but make a fortune at
					the box office. The latest trend in Hollywood seems to make fewer
					such films with large amounts of money invested in them. In this
					article, I take a deeper look at
					<span class="highlight">the movies made so far</span>, the genre
						that appeals to the audience the most, revenue from films in
						recent times, the production studios that make the most from
						making movies, whether movies can influence real life. Let’s look at the
					number of movies released in Hollywood from the beginning to recent
					times.</p>

					typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
					dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
					galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It
					has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
					electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
					popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
					containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
					publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
					Lorem Ipsum.</p>
